There are limitations with multicast, it can't be sent past routers.

You can join a multicast group, and receive information from that group.
It is built into erlang.

Erlang can natively include nodes together

Nodes will have different messages to send out at different times.

1) On start - here I am - talk to me.
2) Periodically - here I am - talk to me.
3) This is my location (as an average of geobot locations - except when empty, uses a default value)
4) Status - load, general activity level, and other significant events (eg, I've been hacked, shutting down)
5) Data sharing - for storage of entities - both locally, and randomly distant for backup purposes
6) Send to entities at a location
