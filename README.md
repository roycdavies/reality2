# Reality2

Reality2 is a distributed platform for 'sentient' digital agents.  We call them sentient because the digital agents can be aware of the network, physical and electronic environment they exist in.  These, we call 'Sentants' - and a group of Sentants is a Swarm.

Small devices running Linux 'run' the Digital Agents, and they are aware of the network and device they are running on.  These devices, or 'Nodes', can form 'Clusters'.

Users interact with the digital agents directly, so the focus of attention is at the Sentant level, not the device level.

That said, at least initially, internet connected devices such as browsers communicate using TCP-IP, which works at the device level, so the interaction with the Sentants does have to go via the node.

Presently, we use a GraphQL API with queries, mutations and subscriptions.

There are many plans for this platform which will be made public in due course.  For now, this is very early alpha stage.
